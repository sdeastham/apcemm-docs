# Community

## Asking questions

If you find a bug, have a request for a new feature, or find that you cannot compile APCEMM with a specific compiler, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/mit-lae/APCEMM/issues).

## Contributing

Any user can contribute code for consideration by the APCEMM development team by submitting a pull request. Every pull request should refer in its commit message to an existing [issue](https://github.com/mit-lae/APCEMM/issues) (whether that's a bug, a compatibility issue, or a feature request); if no issue yet exists, for example if you have developed code to allow a new feature to be implemented which nobody has previously requested, then we ask that you first [raise an issue](https://github.com/mit-lae/APCEMM/issues) and then tag that issue in the pull request.

## Governance

APCEMM is developed and maintained as a freely available, open-source project by a small community of scientists and engineers. The current technical committee is made up of:

* NAME (2025-)
* NAME (2025-)
* NAME (2025-)

The technical committee is responsible for setting the development priorities, as described in the [roadmap](roadmap.md). They are also responsible for reviewing and approving the implementation of new features, and approving the release of new major versions of APCEMM. The technical committee meets once every quarter.

## Getting involved

Technical committee meetings are open to the public, and are made up of two sections:

* Reviewing open issues with APCEMM
* Reviewing and updating the development objectives for the year
* Office hours for the APCEMM community

The details of the next committee meeting are as follows:
