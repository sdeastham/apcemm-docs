## Asking questions

If you find a bug, have a request for a new feature, or find that you cannot compile APCEMM with a specific compiler, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/mit-lae/APCEMM/issues).

## Contributing

Any user can contribute code for consideration by the APCEMM development team by submitting a pull request. Every pull request should refer in its commit message to an existing [issue](https://github.com/mit-lae/APCEMM/issues) (whether that's a bug, a compatibility issue, or a feature request); if no issue yet exists, for example if you have developed code to allow a new feature to be implemented which nobody has previously requested, then we ask that you first [raise an issue](https://github.com/mit-lae/APCEMM/issues) and then tag that issue in the pull request.
